# Power-BI-Project: AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence Dashboard

**üìå Project Overview**
As a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional sales performance, identify high-value customers, and track product-level trends.

This project follows the business intelligence workflow, covering data preparation, modeling, analysis, and visualization to deliver actionable insights.
