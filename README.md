# Power-BI-Project: AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence Dashboard

**Project Overview**
As a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional sales performance, identify high-value customers, and track product-level trends. This project followed the business intelligence workflow, covering data preparation, modeling, analysis, and visualization.

**Project Stages & Methodology**

1. Connecting & Shaping Data
  Extracted and imported data from various sources, including databases and Excel files, using Power Query.
  Performed data cleaning and transformation, including handling missing values, changing data types, and standardizing formats.
  Applied table transformations such as merging, appending, pivoting, and unpivoting data for a structured dataset.
  Used indexing, conditional columns, and rolling calendars to enhance the dataset for analysis.

2. Creating a Relational Data Model
  Designed a star schema model with fact and dimension tables to optimize performance and reporting efficiency.
  Defined relationships using primary and foreign keys, ensuring accurate filter flow and cardinality.
  Implemented hierarchies and bi-directional filtering to improve data navigation and drill-down capabilities.

3. Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
  Developed calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enhance analytical insights.
  Used aggregate functions, logical functions, and iterator (X) functions to calculate key metrics.
  Implemented time intelligence functions for analyzing sales trends over different periods.
  Applied CALCULATE, FILTER, and ALL functions to create custom metrics for sales, revenue, and customer segmentation.

4. Visualizing Data with Reports
  Created interactive reports and dashboards following data visualization best practices.
  Designed KPI cards, line charts, bar charts, and matrix tables to present key insights.
  Added slicers, drill-through, and bookmarks to enhance user interaction and navigation.
  Implemented conditional formatting, Top N filtering, and tooltips for better data representation.
  Designed a mobile-friendly layout and published the report to Power BI Service for accessibility.

**Key Insights & Business Impact**
Identified top-performing products and regions based on sales data.
Highlighted customer segmentation trends to improve targeted marketing efforts.
Provided data-driven recommendations to optimize sales strategies and inventory management.

This project demonstrates my Power BI expertise, including data transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design to deliver actionable insights for business decision-making.
